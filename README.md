# Bible Shovel

A Django-powered web scraper to collect, normalize, and serve Bible text and metadata. The first target is Bible Gateway; the architecture is designed to add more providers later (e.g., ESV API, BibleHub, etc.).

> Note: This repository is in active development. The README documents the intended structure and workflows so we can build towards them.
